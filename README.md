# Hosting a Resume on Github Pages

## Purpose:
The purpose of this README is to explain how to host a resume on GitHub pages.

## Prerequisites

In order to host a resume on git hub you will need the following:

* A resume written in Markdown(See More Resources for a Markdown guide). You may use the one in this repository.
* A GitHub account, in order to create a repository.

## Instructions

Here we're going to assume you already have a resume written in Markdown; either the one provided [here,]() or you can create your own using the Markdown guide referenced below.

1. Start by creating a GitHub account (If you already have an account skip this step).
    1. If you're reading this youre probably already there, but if for whatever reason youre not, go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
    2. Once there, you will be greeted by the following page. ![GitHub Home, not signed in](./Images/GitHubSignup.jpg) In the top right corner, you will see a "Sign up" button. Click that button.
    3. Follow the steps provided, filling out the required information.
2. Once you have an account, sign in. 
    1. Here you will see a page where in the top right corner you can see a little plus sign, which once clicked will produce a drop down menu, and select create a new repository. 
    2. Give your new repository a name, in this case I suggest you name it [your-GitHub-Username].github.io. This will let GitHub know that you want this repository to be created into a website using Github pages. 7
    3. You can go through the rest of the settings for the repository if you wish, but for right now this is unnecessary and you can leave this all default. 
    4. Scroll to the bottom and select "Create Repository".
    5. These steps can be seen in the following gif. ![Create Repo](./Images/CreateARepo.gif)
